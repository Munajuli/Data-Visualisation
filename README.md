The task I have done here will be covering on my classes while at the Bootcamp on the following:

Data and Data Structure
Development of Data sets using Excel
Introduction to Tableau (creating dashboard)

**Scenario 1;**
Data visualisation has become an essential business capability to help transform information into insights that can drive meaningful business outcomes and improved experiences. Today, most organizations have accumulated a wealth of data from the different corners of their businesses they are then unable to see how this data can help them make better decision’s, making actions, and results.
You have been asked to Look at the data workbook and familiarize yourself with this data. You have also been asked to create a visual report that will show the data in the form of charts and maps using Tableau to the cliens requirements. You will also need to considder data protection and computer missuse policies. 

**Task 1**
The first part of your assignments will be to outline what policies need to be adhered to when working with data.
I worked with ‘The Wealth of nations’ data. Investigated by researching the internet or looking back at my notes to tell what and why these policies need to be adhered to while using this data. Also mentioned why it is important to be aware of these rules as a data analyst.  

I have been asked to open the excel table and familiarise myself with it's content. There are three tabs and I will be working with the first tab (GDP) for the excel work. So I will be doing the following tasks shown below, from the attached folder, I have the step by step guide on my workflow.

**GDP Tasks**
Set a password to protect the workbook.
Highlight column C and change the data to display in British Pound symbol.
Turn the GDP sheet into a table. 
Filter the table to display only the information for 2019.
Next create a chart that will only display the following data ‘Rank, Country and GDP - per capita (PPP).  The chart can be anything as long as it is suitable. 

Using your creative skills edit the chart 
a.	Add a title
b.	Add X and Y axis labels
c.	Make the chart visually pleasing 

Move the chart to a new sheet tab and label with a suitable name.
Create a sort for the top 20 highest ranking counties.
Next create a new Bar chart to display the 20 highest ranking countries from your sort and then move the chart to be underneath the table.
Highlighting the area underneath the table and find the add a fill colour icon and sellect a colour.
The next task is to create 3 macro buttons, print the sheet, Save the file and Copy the sheet. 
Using the copy macro, copy the sheet and then paste it into a new word document keeping the formating.  Give the page a title ‘GDP (Gross domestic product)’ .
Save your document as ‘Word Gross domestic product report 1’.
Before you finish with our excel table ‘Gross domestic product’ sheet,  you will add a headder and footer to your table.
After adding the header and footer, save your table as ‘Excel Gross domestic product report 1’
Finally close your word document only.

**Final Task**
Continuing with the Excel table  ‘The Wealth of nations’

The client is colour blind and requested you to bear this in mind when building your dashboard on Tableau. The client is only interested in the top 20 highest ranking countries. All of your visuals should be for the top 20 highest ranking countries. At least 4 charts for the visuals.

As you create your charts, look for the little gray box containing a count of null values. Select the filter option.
Build your dashboard.

All these I have shown in my workflow on the procedures implemented. Fortunately, there were no extreme diffculty encountered during this process.
